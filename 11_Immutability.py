All Fundamental Data types are immutable. i.e once we creates an object,we cannot perform any changes in that object. If we are trying to change then with those changes a new object will be created. This non-chageable behaviour is called immutability.
Advantage : Memory utilization and performance will be improved.

>>> a = 50
>>> b = 50
>>> a is b
True
>>> id(a)
1859120400
>>> id(b)
1859120400
